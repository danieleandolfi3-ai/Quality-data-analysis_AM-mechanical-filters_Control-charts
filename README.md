# Quality-data-analysis_AM-mechanical-filters_Control-charts

In this project we take as input photos of 3D printed mechanical filters obtained in Polimi Made I4.0 competence center.
We extraxt features from the photograph trough image analysis and we build a control chart for detecting possible defects and change in the mean. The core result of this project is that PCA is needed to avoid including too many features and that autocorrelation management beetween images and of different pieces of the same image play a crucial role to avoid statistical mistakes in the control chart creation.

Code and a photograph are provided. Photograph is note related to real dataset is just an example of mechanical filters.
